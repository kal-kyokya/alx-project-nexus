**Repository:** [Futtech](https://github.com/kal-kyokya/Futtech).<br/>
**Deployed App:** [Futtech by Jean-Paul KYOKYA](https://futtech.kalkyokya.tech/about).<br/>
This Project is a GitHub repository dedicated to documenting major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program. This repository serves as a knowledge hub, showcasing understanding of **backend engineering** ```concepts```, ```tools```, and ```best practices``` acquired throughout the program.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for both current and future learnings.
- Foster documenting of frontend and backend learnings.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Covers backend engineering concepts such as ```RESTful APIs```, ```GraphQL APIs```, ```Message Queues```, ```CI/CD Pipelines```, ```Celery & RabbitMQ```, and ```System Design```.
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Includes real-world challenges faced and implemented solutions.
- **Best Practices & Takeaways**: Highlights industry best practices and personal insights.
- **Collaboration Hub**: Encourages teamwork between frontend and backend learners.

## Approach

### Create a GitHub Repository
- Name the repository **alx-project-nexus**.

### Add a README.md File
- Provide an **overview** of the **ProDev Backend Engineering program**.
- Outline major learnings, including:
  - **Key technologies covered**:
    - Python, Django, REST APIs, GraphQL, Docker, CI/CD
  - **Important backend development concepts**:
    - Database Design, Asynchronous Programming, Caching Strategies
  - **Challenges faced and solutions implemented**
